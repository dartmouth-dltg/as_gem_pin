# Local Gems

Acts as a catchall for local gems. Currently holds one gem to pin
nokogiri to ArchivesSpace core version.
=======
# ArchivesSpace Gem Pin

This gem fixes certain gem dependency requirements so that bundler does not install versions that 
might conflct with ArchivesSpace core. It does nothing else.

At present, this only pins `nokogiri` to `v1.12.5`
